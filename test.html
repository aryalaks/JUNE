    <p>Bootstrap 5 is evolving with each release to better utilize CSS variables for global theme styles, individual components, and even utilities. We provide dozens of variables for colors, font styles, and more at a :root level for use anywhere. On components and utilities, CSS variables are scoped to the relevant class and can easily be modified.</p>
